# Combat System Documentation

## Overview

The combat system implements naval battles on a 10x10 hex grid. Ships of different classes occupy different numbers of hexes and have different movement speeds. The system includes movement mechanics, combat actions, and dice roll mechanics based on the Forged in the Dark system.

## Hex Grid System

The combat grid uses a "pointy-top" hex coordinate system with the following properties:

- Grid size: 10x10 hexes
- Coordinate system: uses axial coordinates (q,r) where:
  - q increases from west to east
  - r increases from northwest to southeast
  - (0,0) is the top-left hex

## Ship Classes on the Hex Grid

Ship classes have different sizes and shapes on the hex grid:

1. **Sloop (1-Hex Ship)**
   - Occupies 1 hex
   - Speed: 3 hexes per turn
   - Shape: Single hex

2. **Brigantine (2-Hex Ship)**
   - Occupies 2 hexes in a line
   - Speed: 2 hexes per turn
   - Shape: 2 hexes in a row

3. **Galleon (4-Hex Ship)**
   - Occupies 4 hexes in a kite shape
   - Speed: 1 hex per turn
   - Shape: 1 hex bow, 2 hex midship, 1 hex stern

## Combat Flow

1. **Battle Initialization**
   - Player and enemy ships are placed on opposite sides of the hex grid
   - Turn order is established (player first)

2. **Movement Phase**
   - The player can move their ship up to its maximum speed
   - Movement is done one hex at a time to adjacent hexes
   - Ships cannot move through occupied hexes

3. **Attack Phase** (not yet implemented)
   - After movement, ships can attack if in range
   - Attack success is based on dice rolls from the Forged in the Dark system

4. **End of Turn**
   - Turn passes to the enemy
   - The process repeats until one ship is defeated or retreats

## Game State Integration

Combat state is stored in the gameState object under the combat property with the following structure:

```lua
gameState.combat = {
    grid = {},  -- 2D array representing the hex grid
    playerShip = {
        class = "sloop",  -- Ship class (sloop, brigantine, galleon)
        size = 1,         -- Number of hexes occupied
        position = {5, 5}, -- {q, r} coordinates on grid
        orientation = 0,   -- Direction ship is facing (0-5, for 60Â° increments)
        movesRemaining = 3 -- Based on ship speed
    },
    enemyShip = {
        class = "sloop",
        size = 1,
        position = {2, 2},
        orientation = 3,
        movesRemaining = 3
    },
    turn = "player", -- Whose turn is it (player or enemy)
    phase = "movement", -- Current phase (movement, attack, etc.)
}
```

## Controls

- **Mouse Hover**: Highlights hexes on the grid
- **Click on Player Ship**: Selects the ship and shows valid movement hexes
- **Click on Valid Movement Hex**: Moves the ship to that hex
- **ESC Key**: Exits combat mode
- **C Key**: Debug key to start a test battle

## Triggering Combat

Naval battles can be triggered in two ways:

1. **Random Encounters**: When sailing between zones, there's a 20% chance of encountering an enemy ship
2. **Debug Mode**: Press 'C' key to start a test battle

## Combat Actions

The combat system includes three core actions:

1. **Fire Cannons**: Attack enemy ships
   - Uses the ship's firepower attribute to determine number of dice
   - Each success deals 1 point of damage
   - Damage is applied to the enemy ship's durability

2. **Evade**: Attempt to dodge enemy attacks
   - Uses the ship's class to determine number of dice (sloops get more dice)
   - Each success adds to the ship's evasion rating
   - Evasion rating reduces damage from attacks

3. **Repair**: Fix damage to the ship
   - Base 1 die for repairs
   - Surgeon crew role adds additional dice
   - Each success restores 5 HP to the ship
   - Cannot exceed ship's maximum durability

## Dice Mechanics

The combat system uses a dice pool mechanic based on Forged in the Dark:

- Actions roll a number of six-sided dice (d6) based on ship stats and crew
- Results are categorized:
  - 6: Full success
  - 4-5: Partial success
  - 1-3: Failure
- Outcome is determined by the highest die result, not the sum:
  - If any die shows 6, it's a success
  - If multiple dice show 6, it's a critical success
  - If the highest die is 4-5, it's a partial success
  - If no die shows 4+, it's a failure
- Each outcome level has different effects:
  - Critical Success: Maximum effect (e.g., 3 damage, 15 HP repair)
  - Success: Strong effect (e.g., 2 damage, 10 HP repair)
  - Partial Success: Minimal effect (e.g., 1 damage, 5 HP repair)
  - Failure: No effect

## Game Flow

1. **Combat Initialization**:
   - Player and enemy ships are placed on the grid
   - Ships are given initial stats based on their class

2. **Turn Structure**:
   - Each turn consists of a movement phase and an action phase
   - Players can move their ship during the movement phase
   - Players can perform one action during the action phase

3. **Movement Phase**:
   - Player selects their ship and can move to valid hexes
   - Movement is limited by the ship's speed stat
   - Cannot move through occupied hexes

4. **Action Phase**:
   - Player selects one action (Fire, Evade, Repair)
   - Action results are calculated using dice rolls
   - Enemy AI takes its turn after the player

5. **Combat Resolution**:
   - Combat ends when one ship is destroyed (0 durability)
   - Player can also retreat from battle

## Future Enhancements

1. **Ship Orientation**: Implement proper ship orientation and rotation
2. **Wind Effects**: Integrate with the wind system for movement modifiers
3. **Boarding**: Add boarding mechanics for crew-vs-crew combat
4. **Visual Improvements**: Add proper ship sprites and battle animations
5. **Advanced Actions**: Ram, board, special abilities
6. **Crew Integration**: Deeper crew role impacts on combat
