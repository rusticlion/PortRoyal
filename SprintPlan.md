Total Sprints: 10 (initial plan; adjustable based on progress or 
feedback).
Approach: Agile-inspired, focusing on iterative development, testing, and 
refinement.
Sprint Goals
Deliver functional components incrementally.
Prioritize core gameplay (sea exploration, combat, port management) for 
early playtesting.
Build towards a cohesive pirate adventure with tactical depth and 
strategic management.
Sprint 1: Foundation - Game World and Basic Ship Mechanics
Objective: Establish the game world and basic exploration mechanics.

Tasks:

Create a Caribbean map with 10-15 zones (e.g., calm waters, pirate 
territory) using a hex grid.
Implement basic ship movement:
Moving between zones costs 1 week.
Within-zone hex-to-hex movement is free.
Develop the time management system (72-week campaign).
Add wind direction mechanics affecting movement (e.g., +1 hex with 
favorable wind).
Create placeholder pixel art for sea tiles and ships (Sloop, Brigantine, 
Galleon).
Deliverables:
A navigable Caribbean map with zones and hex grid.
Basic ship movement and time tracking.
Sprint 2: Port Royal and Crew Management
Objective: Build Port Royal as the management hub and introduce crew 
mechanics.

Tasks:

Design Port Royal with key locations (tavern, shipyard) in side-view pixel 
art.
Implement crew recruitment in taverns (basic roles: Navigator, Gunner, 
etc.).
Develop crew management UI (view stats, roles, loyalty).
Set up an inventory system (10 slots for resources/items).
Add basic crew stat impacts (e.g., Navigator adds 1 die to movement 
rolls).
Deliverables:
Functional Port Royal hub with interactive locations.
Basic crew recruitment and management system.
Sprint 3: Combat System - Phase 1
Objective: Introduce core naval combat mechanics.

Tasks:

Create a 10x10 hex-grid battle system.
Implement basic combat actions:
Fire Cannons (attack).
Evade (dodge).
Repair (heal hull).
Develop dice mechanics:
Roll 1-5 d6s based on crew/ship stats.
6 = Success, 4-5 = Partial Success, 1-3 = Failure.
Add simple enemy AI (e.g., moves and fires cannons).
Design combat UI (ship stats, dice results).
Deliverables:
Playable sea combat with dice-based actions.
Basic enemy AI for testing.
Sprint 4: Economic Systems and Investments
Objective: Add trade and investment mechanics for resource management.

Tasks:

Implement trade routes with dynamic pricing across zones.
Develop the investment system:
Stake resources to claim properties (e.g., taverns).
Dice rolls determine outcomes (success = income, failure = loss).
Introduce passive income from investments.
Balance economy for steady progression (e.g., 10-20 gold/week from 
properties).
Add economic UI (track gold, investments).
Deliverables:
Functional trade and investment systems.
Basic economic balance.
Sprint 5: Reputation and Faction System
Objective: Introduce factions and reputation mechanics.

Tasks:

Create four factions (Pirates, Merchants, Navy, Locals) with a -3 to +3 
reputation scale.
Implement reputation shifts based on actions (e.g., raiding lowers Navy 
rep).
Add faction-specific quests (e.g., smuggling for Merchants).
Integrate reputation effects (e.g., +3 Pirates = exclusive crew recruits).
Design faction UI to track relationships.
Deliverables:
Working reputation system with faction interactions.
Initial faction quests.
Sprint 6: Combat System - Phase 2
Objective: Expand combat with boarding and advanced mechanics.

Tasks:

Add advanced actions:
Ram (high-risk hull damage).
Board (triggers side-view crew combat).
Implement crew combat (e.g., dice rolls for melee).
Enhance enemy AI (uses ram/board, adapts to player tactics).
Polish combat UI (animations, sound cues).
Balance combat across ship classes (Sloop = evasion, Galleon = firepower).
Deliverables:
Full combat system with boarding and crew combat.
Improved AI and balance.
Sprint 7: Ship Customization and Upgrades
Objective: Enable ship customization for strategic depth.

Tasks:

Develop customization options:
Sloop: Extra sails (+speed).
Brigantine: More cannons (+firepower).
Galleon: Reinforced hull (+durability).
Implement upgrade system in the shipyard.
Balance upgrades (e.g., speed vs. firepower trade-offs).
Add ship customization UI.
Test ship class distinctions (1-hex Sloop, 4-hex Galleon).
Deliverables:
Functional ship customization system.
Balanced upgrade options.
Sprint 8: Narrative and Quests
Objective: Integrate the main storyline and side quests.

Tasks:

Write and implement the cursed prophecy narrative.
Develop side quests for factions (e.g., retrieve a lost map).
Create NPC dialogue system for quest delivery.
Plan the secret ending (break the curse requirements).
Add narrative triggers (e.g., prophecy hints after week 30).
Deliverables:
Cohesive narrative with main and side quests.
Functional dialogue system.
Sprint 9: Time Management and Events
Objective: Refine time mechanics and add dynamic events.

Tasks:

Finalize the 72-week timeline with earthquake (randomly weeks 60-72).
Implement random events (e.g., storms reduce speed, pirate hunters 
attack).
Add earthquake hints (NPC rumors, tremors from week 50).
Develop prep options: fortify investments, stockpile, evacuate.
Balance event frequency (1-2 per 10 weeks).
Deliverables:
Full time and event systems.
Balanced earthquake mechanics.
Sprint 10: Polish and Optimization
Objective: Refine visuals, performance, and player experience.

Tasks:

Polish pixel art (sea waves, port animations).
Optimize for 800x600 resolution.
Enhance UI/UX (intuitive menus, feedback).
Create a tutorial (cover movement, combat, port actions).
Conduct playtesting and bug fixing.
Deliverables:
Polished, optimized build.
Complete tutorial for new players.
Key Considerations
Dependencies: Sprints build on prior work (e.g., combat expansions need 
Sprint 3). Adjust if blockers arise.
MVP Focus: Sprints 1-3 deliver the core loops (exploration, combat, port 
management) for early testing.
Playtesting: Test after each sprint to validate mechanics and gather 
feedback. Focus on fun and balance.
Flexibility: If time is tight, delay advanced features (e.g., crew traits, 
supernatural elements) for post-Sprint 10 iterations.
Next Steps Beyond Sprint 10
Crew Depth: Add boons/banes (e.g., “Sharp-Eyed” vs. “Cursed”) and loyalty 
mechanics.
Economic Risks: Introduce high-stakes options like raiding navy convoys.
Supernatural: Add low-fantasy quests (e.g., ghost ships).
Endgame: Polish the earthquake and secret ending for replayability.
