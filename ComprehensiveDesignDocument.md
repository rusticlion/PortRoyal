Pirate’s Wager: Blood for Gold – Comprehensive Design Document
1. Game Concept Overview
Setting: A pixel-art pirate adventure set in the 17th-century Caribbean, 
centered on Port Royal, culminating in the historical 1692 earthquake as a 
dramatic endgame event.
Core Gameplay: Players captain a pirate ship, juggling tactical naval 
combat and exploration at sea with crew management, investments, and 
faction relationships in Port Royal.
Unique Selling Points:
Dual gameplay loops: tactical combat/exploration at sea and strategic 
management in port.
Dice-based mechanics inspired by Forged in the Dark, emphasizing risk and 
reward.
Hex-grid naval battles for tactical depth.
A 72-week campaign with the earthquake striking randomly between weeks 
60-72, blending urgency with replayability.
A secret ending where players can break a curse and prevent the 
earthquake.
2. Visual Style
Art Direction: Retro pixel art with a limited tile set, layers, and color 
palettes.
Resolution: 800x600 or smaller for a classic aesthetic.
Sea Tiles: Hex-based grid with animated waves indicating wind direction.
Port Phase: Side-view screens for locations (e.g., tavern, shipyard) with 
detailed pixel art and subtle animations (e.g., flickering lanterns, 
swaying palms).
Aesthetic Goals: A gritty yet charming pirate-era Caribbean, balancing 
immersion with clarity in low resolution.
3. Core Gameplay Loops
3.1 At Sea
Exploration:
The Caribbean is split into 10-15 zones (e.g., calm waters, pirate 
territory, naval routes), each with distinct risks and rewards.
Moving between zones or taking major actions (e.g., combat, exploration) 
costs 1 week; movement within a zone (hex-to-hex) is free.
Combat:
Tactical hex-grid battles on a 10x10 hex grid, with ships sized 1-4 hexes 
based on class.
Wind influences movement and combat, varying by sea region (e.g., calm, 
stormy, trade winds).
Actions: Two per turn—one for movement, one for combat/utility:
Fire Cannons: Attack enemies.
Evade: Dodge incoming fire.
Repair: Mend hull damage.
Ram: Deal high-risk hull damage to foes.
Board: Initiate boarding (shifts to side-view combat).
Dice Mechanics: Roll 1-5 d6s based on crew skills, ship stats, and 
context:
6: Success.
4-5: Partial success (e.g., hit with a drawback).
1-3: Failure (e.g., miss or mishap).
Chase Mechanics: If a ship exits the grid, a dice roll decides escape or 
pursuit.
3.2 In Port Royal
Investments (Claims):
Stake resources (gold, items, crew) and time (1-3 weeks) to claim/upgrade 
properties (e.g., taverns, shipyards).
Dice Rolls: Determine outcomes:
Success: Full benefits (e.g., income, perks).
Partial Success: Benefits with complications (e.g., rival attention).
Failure: Lose some resources, gain a minor perk.
Crew Management: Recruit, train, and manage crew with unique roles and 
stats.
Faction Relationships: Build or strain ties with factions (e.g., pirates, 
navy) via actions.
Earthquake Prep Options:
Fortify Investments: Quake-proof properties.
Stockpile Supplies: Hoard resources for recovery.
Evacuation Plans: Prepare to flee with loot and crew.
4. Ship Classes
Players can command three distinct ship classes, each with unique
