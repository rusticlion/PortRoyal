Description:

Create a user interface to display ship stats, action options, and dice 
results during battles.

Tasks:

Design UI elements in combat.lua:
Ship stats (e.g., "HP: 10/10").
Action buttons (Fire Cannons, Evade, Repair).
Dice result display (e.g., "Rolled: 6, 4 → Success, Partial Success").
Update UI based on game state changes (e.g., HP decreases after damage).
Ensure readability within the 800x600 retro style.
Acceptance Criteria:

UI shows player and enemy ship stats (HP, position).
Action buttons are clickable and trigger corresponding actions.
Dice results display after each action (e.g., "Rolled: 6 → Success").
Notes:

Use placeholder art; refine in Sprint 10.
Refer to Game Boy Advance games (e.g., Fire Emblem) for low-res UI 
inspiration.
Depends on Tickets 3.2 and 3.3.
