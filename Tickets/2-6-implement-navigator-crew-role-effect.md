Description:

Add the Navigator crew roleâ€™s effect to reduce travel time between zones, 
integrating port decisions with sea gameplay.

Tasks:

Modify GameState:calculateTravelTime to check for a Navigator in 
GameState.crew.members (e.g., role == "Navigator").
If a Navigator is present, reduce travel time by 0.5 weeks (e.g., base 1 
week becomes 0.5 weeks), with a minimum of 0.5 weeks.
Update the zone tooltip in map.lua to reflect the reduced travel time when 
a Navigator is active (e.g., "Travel time: 0.5 weeks").
Acceptance Criteria:

Travel time between zones is reduced by 0.5 weeks with a Navigator in the 
crew.
The reduced time is shown in the zone tooltip (e.g., "0.5 weeks" instead 
of "1 week").
Travel time never drops below 0.5 weeks.
Notes:

Assume only one Navigator applies the effect; handle multiple Navigators 
in future sprints.
Test with the existing wind mechanics (e.g., Navigator + "with wind" = 0.5 
weeks minimum).
Update GameState:advanceTime calls in ship.lua to reflect the new travel 
time.
