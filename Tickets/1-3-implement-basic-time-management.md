Ticket 3: Develop Time Management System
Description: Create a system to track time across the 72-week campaign, 
tied to zone transitions.
Tasks:
Initialize a week counter at 1.
Increment the counter by 1 per zone transition.
Display the current week in the UI.
Acceptance Criteria:
The week counter updates correctly with each zone move.
The current week is visible in the game interface.
The system supports up to 72 weeks.
Notes:
Keep it extensible for future actions (e.g., exploration, combat) that 
might cost time.
