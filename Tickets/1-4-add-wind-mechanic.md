Ticket 4: Add Wind Direction Mechanics (Simplified for Sprint 1)
Description: Introduce a basic wind direction affecting zone transitions, 
with visual indicators.
Tasks:
Assign a fixed wind direction per zone (e.g., North, South).
Adjust time costs slightly based on wind (e.g., +1 week against wind, -1 
day with wind, minimum 1 week).
Show wind direction in the tooltip or UI.
Acceptance Criteria:
Wind direction influences zone transition time (e.g., "Calm Waters - 2 
weeks against wind").
Players can see the wind effect in the tooltip or UI.
Notes:
Keep it simple for Sprint 1; no hex-level wind effects since the global 
map isn't hex-based.
Refine in later sprints when within-zone mechanics are added.
