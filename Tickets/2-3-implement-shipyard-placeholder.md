Description:

Create a placeholder shipyard location in Port Royal to set the stage for 
future repair and upgrade functionality.

Tasks:

Design basic side-view pixel art for the shipyard.
Add a "Repair Ship" button that displays a message (e.g., "Repairs not yet 
available").
Include a button to return to the main Port Royal screen.
Acceptance Criteria:

The shipyard screen displays with basic pixel art.
A "Repair Ship" button is present and shows a placeholder message when 
clicked.
Players can return to the main Port Royal screen.
Notes:

This is a placeholder; full functionality (repairs, upgrades) will come in 
Sprint 7.
Keep the art simple but consistent with the retro style.
