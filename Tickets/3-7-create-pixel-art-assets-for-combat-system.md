Description:

Design and implement pixel art for the hex grid and ship sprites during 
battles.

Tasks:

Create hex tile graphics (e.g., hex_tile.png) for the 10x10 grid.
Design or reuse ship sprites (e.g., sloop.png, brigantine.png) from Sprint 
1, ensuring visibility on the grid.
Integrate assets into combat.lua for rendering.
Acceptance Criteria:

Hex grid is visible and fits the retro aesthetic (e.g., simple outlines).
Ship sprites are clear and distinguishable on the grid (e.g., Sloop vs. 
enemy Sloop).
Notes:

Collaborate with the art team for consistency with Sprint 1 assets.
Use low-res constraints (e.g., 16x16 hex tiles).
