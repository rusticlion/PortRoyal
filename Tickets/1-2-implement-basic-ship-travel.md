Ticket 2: Implement Basic Ship Movement Mechanics
Description: Enable the player's ship to move between adjacent zones on 
the global map, with each transition costing 1 week.
Tasks:
Implement a system to track the ship's current zone.
Allow clicking an adjacent zone to initiate movement, advancing time by 1 
week.
Update the ship's position to the new zone upon transition.
Acceptance Criteria:
The player can click an adjacent zone to move the ship there.
Each move between zones increases the week counter by 1 (ties to Ticket 
3).
The ship's new position is reflected on the global map.
Notes:
For Sprint 1, no within-zone movement or hex grids; the ship is simply 
"in" a zone.
Future sprints could add within-zone hex grids if desired.
