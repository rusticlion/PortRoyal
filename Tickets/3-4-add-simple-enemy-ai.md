Description:

Develop basic AI for enemy ships to move and perform actions during 
battles.

Tasks:

Create an AI function in combat.lua to select actions (e.g., move toward 
player, Fire Cannons if in range).
Implement simple rules (e.g., attack if within 3 hexes, else move closer).
Alternate turns between player and AI in the combat loop.
Acceptance Criteria:

Enemy ships move and act during their turns (e.g., move 1 hex, fire if 
close).
AI behavior is predictable (e.g., always attacks when in range).
Turns alternate smoothly between player and AI.
Notes:

Use a basic enemy ship (e.g., Sloop stats: 1 hex, 2 firepower, 10 HP).
Depends on Tickets 3.1 and 3.2 for grid and actions.
